    # Algorithm Overview: only non-overlapping time intervals with worker counts
    # will be inserted into the workforce list. We will process Volunteer
    # objects from the workers list one at a time. If a Volunteer object we are
    # processing does not overlap with the current workforce, we simply
    # insert workforce. If a Volunteer object results in an overlap, we will
    # split that it into the Volunteer object into multiple ones, adjust
    # volunteer counts in the existing workforce and insert new resulting
    # Volunteer objects back into our workers list to be
    # processed later.
    # Algorithm:
    # Always keep the workers list sorted: first by start time, then by end time
    # Repeat until workers list is empty:
    #   Insert the first Volunteer object from workers to workforce,
    #   possibly dividing a Volunteer object in workforce into multiple
    #   (slicing the time interval)
    #   If new Volunteer objects are created in the process, they get added to
    #   the workers list.

    # (Volunteer object from the workforce list), and w is the number of
