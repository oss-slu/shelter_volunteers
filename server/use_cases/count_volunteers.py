    # Algorithm Overview: only non-overlapping time intervals with worker counts
    # will be inserted into the workforce list. We will process Staffing objects
    # from the workers list one at a time. If a Staffing object we are
    # processing does not overlap with the current workforce, we simply insert
    # workforce. If a Staffing object results in an overlap, we will split that
    # it into the Staffing object into multiple ones, adjust volunteer counts in
    # the existin gworkforce and insert new resulting Staffing objects back into
    # our workers list to be processed later.
    #
    # Algorithm:
    # Always keep the workers list sorted: first by start time, then by end time
    # Repeat until workers list is empty:
    #   Insert the first Staffing object from workers to workforce,
    #   possibly dividing a Staffing object in workforce into multiple
    #   (slicing the time interval)
    #   If new Staffing objects are created in the process, they get added to
    #   the workers list.

    # (Staffing object from the workforce list), and w is the number of
