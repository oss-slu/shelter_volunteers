# Leadership Capacity Building Activity
### Bi-Weekly Product Enhancement & Strategic Review Meetings with World Wide Technology (WWT)  
### **Role:** Technical Lead – Shelter Volunteers Project  

---

## 1. **Activity Overview**
I have taken on the responsibility of leading recurring bi-weekly strategic product enhancement meetings with the World Wide Technology (WWT) team—an initiative that goes beyond the standard expectations of a technical lead. These meetings function as a structured forum for reviewing project direction, evaluating enhancement opportunities, and aligning the Shelter Volunteers application with industry-level engineering and product management practices.

As the **Technical Lead**, I take the responsibility of organizing, structuring, and driving these discussions. This includes preparing project updates, gathering technical and product challenges from the development team, proposing enhancement ideas, evaluating user-facing issues, and guiding conversations to ensure decisions reflect both community needs and professional software standards.

Each meeting results in documented strategic decisions, updated backlog items, clarified requirements, and adjustments to the long-term product roadmap—forming a critical bridge between student development work and industry-level expectations.

## 2. **Leadership Responsibilities & Contributions**

### 2.1 **Strategic Product Planning**
During every meeting, I guide a structured evaluation of:

#### **A. Project Progress**
- Summary of commits and development completed since last meeting  
- Current performance or UX challenges  
- Bugs or blockers requiring design reconsideration  
- System limitations identified during sprint cycles  

#### **B. Proposed Enhancements**
I prepare proposals based on:
- User flow observations  
- Developer feedback  
- Data logic issues  
- UI/UX inconsistencies  
- Architecture inefficiencies  

Each proposal is formatted with:
- Clear problem definition  
- User or system impact  
- Technical notes  
- Risk and dependency considerations  
- Implementation feasibility  

These are reviewed with WWT for expert validation and refinement.

#### **C. Integrating Professional Guidance**
WWT provides insights on:
- Scalable system design  
- Secure development practices  
- Effective data management  
- Modern UI/UX approaches  
- Best practices for maintainability  
- Long-term architecture planning  

I translate these insights into actionable improvements for the project.

### 2.2 **Creation of Product Management Frameworks**

#### **A. Standardized Meeting Framework**
I developed a repeatable meeting structure used every two weeks:

1. Project progress overview  
2. Review of last session’s action items  
3. Proposed enhancements and technical discussions  
4. Architecture and feature considerations  
5. WWT review and technical feedback  
6. Decisions made  
7. Action plan for next sprint  
8. Roadmap adjustments  

This ensures consistency, efficiency, and clarity.

#### **B. Backlog Refinement Process**
Following each meeting, I update the backlog with:
- Revised user stories  
- Improved acceptance criteria  
- Priority levels based on WWT guidance  
- Technical notes for implementation clarity  
- New enhancement tasks  

This ensures the backlog accurately reflects the strategic direction.

#### **C. Roadmap Development**
I maintain and expand the long-term roadmap by incorporating:
- Insights from WWT  
- Dependencies between components  
- Critical path items  
- High-value features  
- Technical debt items  
- Implementation phases

### 2.3 **Cross-Team & External Collaboration**

#### **A. Project Representative**
As the project’s technical representative, I:
- Communicate sprint progress  
- Clarify constraints and system behavior  
- Present technical decisions  
- Align project vision with community expectations  

#### **B. Bridging Student Developers and Industry Professionals**
I bring WWT insights back to the student development team through:
- Sprint planning  
- Internal meetings  
- Documentation updates  
- Issue refinement sessions  

This ensures that real-world feedback directly influences our development work.
