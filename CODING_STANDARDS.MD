# Coding Standards 

### General Best Practices
- Make sure to add unit test cases when adding new functionality and ensure added code is written in a testable manner.
- All functions should have a description of their purpose and details of the parameters.
- Soft limit of 100 characters per line.
- Each issue should link to one pull request unless the changes are only 1-3 lines and are relavant to an existing pull request.

### Python Best Practices
- Use snake-case for multi-word classes, variables, and functions.

### JavaScript Best Practices
- Comments must be with multi-line comment style <code>/* Example Comment */</code>
- Newly added components should have their own .css styling sheet instead of adding to index.css.
- Use ; at the end of lines.
- Use camel-case for multi-word classes, variables, and functions.
- When creating components for the front-end, ensure that it is done so modularly, for readability and so the components are reusable.
- Use tabs (4 spaces) for indentation.
- Make tags with code blocks on separate lines. 
```
<div>
  /*Code Block*/
<\div>
```
