# Application for shelter volunteers to manage their volunteer time

This application is a work in progress. It uses Flask server with a React JS client.


To run the code using one command with Docker Compose, please follow the below instructions:

1. Install Docker on your computer if you do not have one (https://www.docker.com/get-started/)

2. Open the Docker app to start the docker engine (if you are on windows, open services.msc using run command and make sure the docker desktop service is running)

3. Open terminal or shell and run the below command in the the cloned repository
<br><code>docker-compose up</code>

4. For development purposes, use developer@slu.edu as the username and any password, to bypass authentication. This only works when server is running in DEBUG mode and DEV_USER and DEV_CONFIG configurations are enabled.
